## My reductionist attacks on books that I despise


Sometimes I do music. I actually minored in music in college, where I did lots of singing, and still enjoy doing so.

I'm currently super into Liszt's transciptions of some of Schubert's songs, and am especially enthralled with Kissin's performance of *Gretchen am Spinnrade*.
